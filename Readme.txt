Steps to Run Assignment:
1. Extract 21111063.zip in your local system
2. Extract "hi.zip" and "Wordsimilarity.zip" in folder "Q1" so that you can see these 2 folders when you open "Q1" folder.
3. Copy "q2.ipynb" and "q3.ipynb" to the root folder of your google drive and open in Google Colab.
4. Additionally upload "UNIGRAM", "BIGRAM" and "TRIGRAM" files located in "Q3" folder to the root folder of your google drive.
5. Additionally upload "hi_train.conll" and "hi_test.conll" files located in "Q3" folder to the root folder of your google drive.
5. RUN the makefile by typing "make run" in 21111063 folder.
6. The csv output files will be generated in folder "Q1".


Additional Information:

Question1: This question will generate 40 csv files in Q1 folder when you type make run command. Please keep in mind that the datasets and models ("hi" and "Wordsimilarity") should be located in same folder as q1.ipynb file.

Question2: This question will run in Google Colab only due to memory constraints of local machine. To run this, upload "q2.ipynb" in google colab and run it.\

Question3: This question will run in Google Colab only due to memory constraints of local machine. To run this, upload "q3.ipynb" in the root folder of your google drive along with "UNIGRAM", "BIGRAM" and "TRIGRAM" files located in "Q3" folder. These 3 files are pickle files storing dictionary. These have been created manually. These have been created to speed up the process. Otherwise it may take upto 24 hours.\
That is why, pickle files have been saved.
